                Investors consider Uganda’s agricultural potential to be among the best in Africa,     
Eighty percent of Uganda’s land is arable but only 35% is being cultivated.  In fiscal year 2020/2021, 

                    <ol class="nested">
                <li>with low temperature variability, fertile soils</li>
                <li>and two rainy seasons over much of the country.- leading to multiple crop harvests per year.
                    <li>According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, Uganda’s fertile agricultural land has the potential to feed 200 million people.</li>
                    <li> agriculture accounted for about 23.7% of GDP, and 31% of export earnings. </li>
                    <li>The UBOS estimates that about 70% of Uganda’s working population is employed in agriculture. </li>

              <p class="text">
                Farm management software centralizes, manages, and optimizes the production activities and operations of farms. With farm management software, farmers can become strategic and efficiently plan in their daily farm-related tasks and responsibilities. Farm Smartly software automates the access and provision of farm data, monitors and analyzes the weather changes  and tracks the climatic  changes to predict rainfall patterns. Additionally, the software can support farmers with information from highly trained and passionate experts programs,podcast and videos ,       </p>

              <h3>Who Can Use Farm Smartly?</h3>
              <p>Farmers — Farmers benefit greatly from farm management software and generally take advantage of the main features, including crop and field management, livestock management, and inventory management. Streamlining crop monitoring, livestock monitoring, and other central aspects of farming is both cost-effective and resource-effective.br

                Growers — For growers, farm management streamlines the important aspects of growing and harvesting, such as weather pattern monitoring, mapping, and crop <management class="br"></management>
                
                Agronomists — An agronomist is a soil management and crop production expert. Farm management software helps agronomists understand crop profitably, as well as track soil and crop samples. Agronomists can also use crop reporting tools within farm management software to better understand the impacts that weather and other uncontrollable patterns have on crops and <soil class="br"></soil>
                
                </p>
              <h3>What are the Different Kinds of Farm Management Software?</h3>
              <p class="text">
                Large Farm Management — For large farms, an integral benefit farm management solutions can provide is large-scale farming insights. The larger the farm, the more difficult it is to keep track of compliance issues, livestock, and supplier records. Farm management solutions that are tailored to larger farms help standardize productivity and streamline all aspects of an enterprise farm.

Small Farm Management — While the features are similar to the large farm version, small farm management software focuses more on providing easy access to crop information, farm health overviews, and inventory insights.

                Crop growth is closely related to the weather. Some crops require certain high or low temperatures to start their germination and continue further development. On the other hand, temperatures in combination with humidity are often used to predict various insect pest and disease occurrences. Based on this information, farmers can plan times for sowing, protection, harvesting, and other field activities in order to avoid negative weather effects and yield losses.

is the only factor in determining crop yields. It includes weather observations of every field to provide information on current crop growing conditions.

Weather monitoring offers a set of measurement options to provide useful information about soil and crop conditions,
